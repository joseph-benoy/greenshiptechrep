\subsection{Stowage model}
In this section we present the stowage model that is the point of origin for our projected capacity model. In other words, this model describes the (in)equality system which we want to project. The model is adapted from the PhD thesis of Delgado \cite{AlbertosThesis}; other models for stowage planning using actual vessel profiles can be found in e.g. \cite{DariosThesis}, \cite{pacino11} and \cite{pacino12}. We will not go into details of the model in this report, but will only present the essentials; the reader is referred to \cite{AlbertosThesis} %and \cite{pacino12} 
for further details.

\subsubsection*{Description}
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:vessel}, the cargo space of a container vessel is divided into
sections called \textit{bays} that each are divided into a grid by stacks and tiers (Figure~\ref{fig:bay_a}). Each stack and tier constitute a \emph{cell} that consists of two \emph{slots}.

\label{fig:bay}
\end{figure*}

The containers transported on a vessel usually have a standard size that fits the cells and slots; the containers are normally (ISO standard) $8'$ wide, $8'6''$ high and $20'$,
$40'$ or $45'$ long, though we do not consider the latter in this report. Accordingly, a cell can hold either two $20'$ containers (one in each slot) or one $40'$ container (Figure~\ref{fig:bay_b}). Further, some containers are refrigerated (\emph{reefers}), and must be stowed at a power plug. 
The corners of the containers are constructed such that containers can be stacked, though $20'$ containers cannot
be stacked on top of $40'$ containers due to the lack of corner supports in th middle of $40'$ containers (see Figure~\ref{fig:bay_b}). 

The capacity of a container vessel is given in \emph{TEU} (Twenty-foot Equivalent Units), i.e. a standard $20'$ container as described above takes up one TEU, while a $40'$ container takes up two TEU. Each stack has a height and weight limit. Separate total weight limits for $20'$ and $40'$ containers exist, since only $20'$ containers rest on the middle support posts of the stack, while the end posts hold weight of $20'$ and $40'$ containers (Figure~\ref{fig:bay_b}). 

Though containers physically are placed in specific slots, the stowage models considered {specifies} how many containers of each \emph{type} should be placed in the subsections of each bay, called \emph{locations}. 
These locations emerge by dividing the bays {vertically} into sections on deck and below deck, respectively, and {horizontally} into a center section and symmetric side-sections, respectively; see Figure~\ref{fig:bay_a} which shows a bay divided into four location indicated by their number. The type of containers is here specified by the length, reefer-property and a weight class. The capacities for stacks translate to capacities for locations.

Besides the location-based capacity constraints, global hydrostatic constraints ensure the stability of the vessel. 
Stress forces arise as a result of gravitation acting downwards on the vessel and buoyancy acting upwards. Limits on these stress forces are given for a set of points along the vessel called \emph{frames}. %Figure~\ref{fig:vessel} shows the distribution of the vertical forces (resulting from gravitation and buoyancy) along the \red{sections/frames/bays} of the vessel. 
Buoyancy comes from the vessel's displacement of water and hence depends on the varying (and irregular) shape of the hull, which is given at a set of reference points called \emph{stations} (Figure~\ref{fig:stations}). At these stations, the area submerged in water can be approximated by linear functions of the vessel's displacement and longitudinal center of gravity (\emph{lcg}), and from this an approximation of the buoyancy force of the vessel between two consecutive stations can be calculated. 
Further hydrostatic constraints for ensuring the stability of the vessel is considered in \cite{AlbertosThesis} but is not considered here.

\caption{Stations of a vessel. Adapted from \cite{AlbertosThesis}.}
\label{fig:stations}
\end{figure}

Besides containers, vessels also carry ballast tanks in fixed positions along the vessel that can be filled with water. Doing this help handling the stability of the vessel so that otherwise unfeasible stowage configurations can be {achived}. {Bounds for these ballast tanks can be defined as well as an overall upper bound for these.}

\subsubsection*{Sets, variables, constants}
To formally describe the stacking and stability constraints of the considered stowage models, we use the sets, variables and constants summarized in Table~\ref{table:sets}, Table~\ref{table:vars} and Table~\ref{table:constants}, respectively.

\subsubsection*{Constraints}
\paragraph{Location-based capacity constraints}
Firstly, we have constraints that ensure that for each location of the vessel, the stowed containers are within the allowed capacities w.r.t. the number of $20'$ containers, $40'$ containers, TEUs, and the weight of the $20'$ and $40'$ containers, respectively. These constraint are modeled in the inequalities \eqref{20Cap}-\eqref{weight40Cap} below.
{Likewise, we have a constraint, \eqref{combinedWeightCap}, that ensures that the weight of a location is within limits, taken the different distribution of the weight of $40'$ containers, respectively $20'$ containers, within a slot into consideration; the weight of a $40'$ container is distributed on the four outer corner places of a slot while the weight of $20'$ containers also rest on the inner corners of the slot.}
Lastly, \eqref{reeferSlotCap} and \eqref{reeferCellCap} ensure that each reefer container can be refrigerated, and that {the total number of cells taken up by the reefer containers are within capacity}, respectively. 
\begin{align}
{\forall l \in L:}&\quad

\end{align}	 
%
\paragraph{Defined variables and bounds}
The constraint in \eqref{typeDef} defines the variables, $x_\tau$, that specifies how many containers of a specific type $\tau$ is stowed on the vessel. These are the variables that we want the projected (in)equality system to be expressed in.
\begin{equation}
\label{typeDef}%\tag{Type definition}
	\forall{\tau \in T}: x_\tau = \sum_{l\in L} x_{l,\tau}
\end{equation}
\eqref{totalWeightDef} below defines the total weight of the containers stowed in each location, since this number is used in further calculations of the hydrostatic constraints (see further below). 
\begin{equation}
%\tag{Total weight definition}
\label{totalWeightDef}
	\forall l \in L:\quad \weight_l = \sum_{\tau \in T} \Weight_\tau\cdot x_{l,\tau}\\
\end{equation}
We also ensure that the number of containers placed at each location of each type as well as the amount of ballast in the ballast tanks is positive. %The positivity of $\weight_l$ and $x_\tau$ follows from these bounds, so we do not need to include those\marginpar{or should I?}.
%\begin{align}
%\label{btPos}
%	\forall b\in BT:&\quad x_{b}\geq 0.
%\label{wPos}
%	\forall l\in L:& w_{l}\geq 0.\\
%\label{typePos}
%	\forall l\in L, \tau\in T:& x_{l,\tau}\geq 0.\\
%\end{align}
For the ballast tanks, we also require that each tank's content is within limits, as well as the total content. These constraints are given in \eqref{btLim} and \eqref{BTLim} below.
\begin{align}
\label{xPos}
	\forall l\in L, \tau\in T:&\quad x_{l,\tau}\geq 0.\\
%\tag{Limits for each tank}
\label{btLim}
	\forall b \in BT:	&\quad 0 \leq x_b \leq \mi{UB}(x_b)\\ 
%
%\tag{Limits for total weight of tanks}
\label{BTLim}
	\mi{lb}(\trt{WBT}) &\leq \sum_{b \in BT} x_b	\leq \mi{UB}(\trt{WBT})
\end{align}
%
\paragraph{Hydrostatic constraints}
%For vessel stability, the model in \cite{AlbertosThesis} uses variable displacement, and for this it uses discrete displacement intervals.  
%To avoid integer variables we consider here a constant displacement interval, \red{and we assume that the stowed containers lie within $75$ to $85$ percent of the vessel's maximal allowable displacement.} \marginpar{maybe put in model}
At each station the submerged area of the cross-section has been linearized as a function of the lcg, and the buoyancy force for each section between consecutive stations are calculated as the average of the two areas times the distance between the two stations \eqref{bonjeanVarDef}. 
Instead of calculating the vessel's lcg, we only require it to be within a given interval \eqref{lcgLim}.
%For each bonjean station $s$ (except the last) %\red{(well, it is measured in between two stations and the assigned to the first station)}, 
%a bonjean variable is defined as the average \red{of something ... of the station $s$ and the next station, that is, the variable defines the averaged force in the middle between the two stations}.

The shear forces at each frame can then be calculated as the sum of the constant weight of the vessel fore (aft) the frame, the weight of the containers and ballast tanks for (aft) the frame, and the buoyancy fore (aft) the frame, the latter of which which will be negative, see \eqref{eq:shear}. For each of the frames, we then require these shear forces to be within limits \eqref{shearLimits}.   
\begin{gather}
\forall s_i \in S'\setminus\{s_S\}:\;
\bonjean_{s_i} = \frac{1}{2}\cdot D_{s_i}\cdot(\Bonj^\trt{W}_{s_i} + \mi{lcg}\cdot \Bonj^\trt{lcg}_{s_i}	+ \Bonj^\trt{W}_{s_{i+1}} + \mi{lcg}\cdot \Bonj^\trt{lcg}_{s_{i+1}})
\label{bonjeanVarDef}\\
%
\mi{lb}(\mi{lcg}) \leq \mi{lcg} \leq \mi{UB}(\mi{lcg})
\label{lcgLim}\\
%
\forall {e}\in\{\trt{f},\trt{a}\}, f \in \Sec^{e}:\;
\shear_f = W^{e}_f+ \sum_{l\in L} \weight_l\cdot \Prop_{f,l}^{e} + \sum_{b \in BT} x_b\cdot \Prop^{e}_{f,b} 	+ \smashoperator{\sum_{s_i \in S'\setminus\{s_S\}}}\bonjean_{s_i}\cdot \Prop^{e}_{f,s_i}
\label{eq:shear}\\
%
\forall f \in \Sec:\;	\mi{lb}(\shear_f)\leq	\shear_f \leq \mi{UB}(\shear_f)
\label{shearLimits}
\end{gather}
%
\subsection{Test results}\label{sec:testResults}
To do a nested decomposition (see section \ref{sec:nested}), we will, though, divide the constraints in \eqref{eq:shear} in a part coming from the containers, ballast tanks and bouyancy, respectively, using auxiliary variables. Thus \eqref{eq:shear} is replaced with \eqref{shearLocDef}-\eqref{shearDef} below.
\begin{align}
\label{shearLocDef} 
\forall {e}\in\{\trt{f},\trt{a}\}, f \in \Sec^{e}:&\;
	\shear^{\trt{c},e}_f = \sum_{l \in L} \weight_l\cdot \Prop^{e}_{f,l}\\
%
\forall {e}\in\{\trt{f},\trt{a}\}, f \in \Sec^{e}:&\;
	\label{shearTanksDef}
	\shear^{\trt{bt},e}_f = \sum_{b \in \mi{BT}} x_b\cdot \Prop^{e}_{f,b} \\		
%
\forall {e}\in\{\trt{f},\trt{a}\}, f \in \Sec^{e}:&\;
	\label{shearBonjDef}
	\shear^{\trt{bc},e}_f = \sum_{s_i \in S'\setminus\{s_S\}} \bonjean_{s_i}\cdot \Prop^{e}_{f,s_i} \\
%
\forall {e}\in\{\trt{f},\trt{a}\}, f \in \Sec^\trt{e}:&\;
	\label{shearDef}
 	\shear_f = W^{e}_f +	\shear^{\trt{c},e}_f+ \shear^{\trt{bt},e}_f + \shear^{\trt{bc},e}_f
\end{align}
%
%
We have tested our methods on three different models, each including a different number of the constraints presented in the previous section and above. In all cases, we wanted a model capturing all the dependencies between the  variables $x_\tau$, and only those. Hence we project the variables $\VAR(S)\setminus \set{x_\tau}{\tau\in T}$ where $S$ is the system consisting of the (in)equalities corresponding to the constraints of the model.

We have used data from our industrial partner, Maersk, from a vessel with a capacity of $15.500$ TEU, $91$ locations, $27$ ballast tanks and $33$ stations. There are $25$ frame points, however, we have only used one fore and one aft (in the two models considering hydrostatics). In all models, we considered 12 types, $T = \{20', 40'\}\times \{6t, 21t, 27t\}\times\{\trt{R}, \trt{NR}\}$, that are defined according to the length, the weight class and the reefer property of the containers.

In the two tables below we show which (in)equalities are present in the 3 (in)equality systems $S_1$, $S_2$ and $S_3$ that have been tested, and we state the size of each model given in number of (in)equalities, number of variables and the two numbers multiplied. Similarly we present the size of the projected (in)equality systems together with the approximate time taken to obtain those projections. 

The (in)equality system $S_1$ includes $3$ capacity constraints per location and shear force calculations at $2$ frame points; $S_2$ includes all capacity constraints for each location but no calculations of shear forces. $S_3$ includes 6 capacity constraints per location and shear force calculations at the two frames.

The test have been done on a laptop with an Intel$^\text{\textregistered}$ Core\texttrademark\; i7-4600U-processor with a frequency of 2.10-3.3 GHz, 8GB RAM, and with 2 cores and 4 threads. The computer has also been used to perform other tasks while doing the projection, and 3 threads were used to run the parallel redundancy checks. The time used to make the projection is therefore not accurate, but still gives an indication of the running time (especially when these are compared across the test results).

In all three test cases, the system consisting of the (in)equalities using $x_{l,\tau}$ and $\weight_l$ were set aside; this is the system corresponding to the constraints \eqref{20Cap}-\eqref{xPos} (for $S_2$) plus \eqref{shearLocDef} (for $S_1$ and $S_3$). Then these systems were decomposed according to the locations, and the variables $x_{l,\tau}$ and $\weight_l$ were eliminated, leaving a system over $x_\tau$ (for $S_1$), or $x_\tau$ and $\shear^{\trt{c},e}_f$ (for $S_1$ and $S_3$). The decomposition was done such that $X_i = \set{x_{l,\tau}}{\tau \in T, l\in P^0_i}\cup\set{\weight_l}{l\in P^0_i}$ for each $1\leq i \leq 45$, where  
\begin{align*}

For $S_1$ and $S_3$, the list of partitions $\mathfrak{P}$ was $\mathfrak{P} = (\mathbb{P}^1, \mathbb{P}^2, \mathbb{P}^3, \mathbb{P}^4, \mathbb{P}^5)$, where

For $S_2$, the partitions where $\mathfrak{P}' = (\mathbb{P}'^1, \mathbb{P}'^2, \mathbb{P}'^3, \mathbb{P}'^4, \mathbb{P}'^5)$, where 
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{P}'^1 &= \mathbb{P}'^1,\\  
\mathbb{P}'^2 &= \big\{ \{0,1\}, \{2,3\}, \{4,5\}, \{6,16\}, \{8,9\}, \{10,18\}, \{12,13\}, \{14,15\}, \{7,17\},
						   \{11,19\},\\& \{20,21\}, \{22\} \big\},\\
\mathbb{P}'^3 &= \big\{ \{0,2\}, \{1,3\}, \{4,6\}, \{5,7\}, \{8,10\}, \{9,11\} \big\},\\
\mathbb{P}'^4 &= \big\{ \{0,1\}, \{2,4\}, \{3,5\} \big\},\\
\mathbb{P}'^5 & = \mathbb{P}^5.
\end{align*}

The reason for having $\mathfrak{P}'$ like this (and not just ``numerical'') was to ``pair'' partitions according to the size of the produced (sub)projections such that some of the smaller projections were paired with some of the larger projection. The reason that some of the (sub)projections were smaller is partly that some of the locations have no reefer capacity, so $x_{l,\tau}$ for such a location and a $\tau$ that is a reefer type is quickly set to $0$, which makes the projection smaller.

For $S_2$, making the above projection resulted in the required system expressed only in the $x_\tau$-variables.

For both $S_1$ and $S_3$ we projected yet two more subsystems; the subsystem consisting of the (in)equalities relating to buoyancy (\eqref{bonjeanVarDef}, \eqref{lcgLim}  and \eqref{shearBonjDef}) were projected w.r.t. $lcg$ and $\bonjean_s$ (leaving only the $\shear^{\trt{bc,f}}_f$ and $\shear^{\trt{bc,a}}_f$ variables), while the subsystem relating to ballast tanks (\eqref{btLim}, \eqref{BTLim} and \eqref{shearTanksDef}) were projected w.r.t. $x_b$ (leaving the $\shear^\trt{bt,f}_f$ and $\shear^\trt{bt,a}_f$ variables). 
For both $S_1$ and $S_3$, the three projected subsystems were then joined together with the (in)equalities \eqref{shearLimits} and \eqref{shearDef}, relating to the shear force. In this final system, we then eliminated the $\shear^{\trt{c},e}_f$, $\shear^{\trt{bt},e}_f$, $\shear^{\trt{bc},e}_f$, and the $\shear_f$-variables, which resulted in a system over the $x_\tau$-variables as required. %\marginpar{Actually, we had the \eqref{shearLocDef} included in the ``container''-part, but I am not sure if this makes a difference}

To give the reader an idea of the how the number of (in)equalities and variables, respectively progress, Figure~\ref{fig:FinalProjectionS1}, Figure~\ref{fig:FinalProjectionS2} and Figure~\ref{fig:FinalProjectionS3} show the evolution of these numbers when projecting the mentioned final system stemming from $S_3$, which is the system producing the largest intermediary systems. Each ``step'' in these graphs corresponds to either the preprocessing or ''clean-up'' (as a whole), Gauss-elimination of one variable, FM-elimination of one variable, or a complete redundancy removal of the system. The first part where the number of (in)equalities is reasonable stable (when seen in this scale) corresponds to the preprocessing and Gauss-elimination part. 
This is followed by repeated steps of FM-elimination (the ``peaks'' in the number of (in)equalities), clean-up (the ``flat'' part after the peaks) and redundancy removal (the ``valleys'').

We note that $S_3$ is the most time-consuming system to project of the three, and the final system as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:FinalProjectionS3} is by far the system (of all the subsystems that are projected) that produced the biggest intermediary systems.
