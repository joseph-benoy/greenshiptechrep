\begin{abstract}
Due to its high computational complexity, Fourier-Motzkin-Elimination (FME) is mainly known as a theoretical approach to determine feasibility of a linear program (LP). Current practical applications of FME in static program analysis and logic programming exploit that it is a transformation corresponding to existential quantification in logic, but large-scale variable elimination has not been attempted so far. In this report, we introduce a novel FME-based framework for massive variable elimination that takes advantage of the block structure found in many LP problems. Our objective is to simplify the LP by eliminating most of its variables. We show that this is possible for defining accurate capacity models for container vessels by deriving them from stowage models.
